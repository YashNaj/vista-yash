<h1>Vista Metals Demo CRUD Application </h1>
<p>
  This app is written in Sveltekit 2. 
	It is a simple user/post manager. 
</p>
<p>It includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>

	</li>
 <li>
	basic reactivtiy	
	</li>
 <li>
		dynamic routing
	</li>
	<li>
		simple animations
	</li>
	<li>
Prisma/Sqlite adapter.		
	</li>
		<li>
full a11y compliancy 
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	 
There is a complex user table component which features filtering, pagination, sorting by columnar value, and a bulk select delete option. 

For the sake of time the rest of the UI is fairly basic. 

If you would like, I would be happy to explain   my process or expand/flesh out features.
