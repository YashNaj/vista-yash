<h1>Vista Metals Demo CRUD Application </h1>
<p>
  This app is written in Sveltekit 2^. It is a simple user/post manager. zod validated CRUD forms, reactivtiy, dynamic routing, and simple animations are present. All components are a11y compliant. Prisma is used as the ORM with a Sqlite adapter. 

There is a complex user table component which features filtering, pagination, sorting by columnar value, and a bulk select delete option. 

For the sake of time the rest of the UI is fairly basic. 

If you would like I would be happy to explain my process or expand/flesh out features.
